# Face-dectection app

Vue.js app using the face recognition API [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js).

Users' webcams are connected to the site and their faces are automatically detected by the API.
The API indicates users' age, gender, and emotion. Users take a screenshot and upload the image to the site.

The images that have been uploaded are displayed on scroll below the cam section. A modal box appears by clicking on each image and users can leave comments. Each image also has a specific url that users can send for reference.

I've automated a regular clean-up of the images in the database with Node Cron to prevent overflow.
